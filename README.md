# Molecular Dynamics 

This program simulates molecular interactions of monoatomic molecules and particles with many molecules in a 2D region of calculus. 
The development of this code was part of a graduante reseach project of the author's Master Degree at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at University of Campinas. 

## Compilation

The Fortran code can be compiled using mpiifort (Intel Fortran Compiler) or mpifort (GCC Fortran). You may change the make file to choose the compiler that you wish. 

## Requirements
GNU Fortran 
```
sudo apt-get install gfortran # Ubuntu Based distros
sudo zypper in gcc-fortran # OpenSUSE
```
Or [Intel Fortran Compiler](https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers)

If using GNU Fortran, install also the OpenMPI package
```
sudo apt-get install --reinstall openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev # Ubuntu 
sudo zypper in openmpi openmpi-devel # OpenSUSE
```
For the Python code it is necessary the pyevtk package to convert the csv files to vtk. 
The package progressbar2 is optional. 

For the visualization, you can use Paraview or some program that reads VTK files.
